# Cross-Sell-Insurance-Business-Simulation-And-Modelling
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer interest in Cross-Selling in the Insurance industry. Still, many of the technical aspects are controlled by business requirements. We would not develop a machine learning model that predicts the best but a model that adheres to business.

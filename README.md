# Cross-Sell-Insurance-Business-Simulation
This project is to develop a machine learning model to predict customer interested for Cross-Selling in Insurance industry but many of the technical aspects are controlled from the business requirements. We would not develop a machine learning model that predict the best, but the model that adhere to business.

The dataset coming from Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction
